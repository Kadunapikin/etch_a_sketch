# etch_a_sketch 
Create a new html, css  and js file.
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Put the grid squares inside another container "div"
Make the divs appear as a grid
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
Add a three buttons to the botom of the screen that will either select black or random color, and also reset the board to start drawing afresh.
Add an EventListener to the body to enable a user click to stop drawing and click to draw again.
